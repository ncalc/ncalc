# Values

A value is a terminal token representing a concrete element. This can be:

* an integer
* a floating point number
* a date time
* a boolean
* a string
* a function
* a parameter

## Integers

They are represented using numbers. 

```
123456
```

They are evaluated as **Int32**.

## Floating point numbers

Use the dot to define the decimal part. 

```
123.456
.123
```
They are evaluated as **Double**, unless you use `ExpressionOptions.DecimalAsDefault`

## Scientific notation

You can use the e to define power of ten (10^).
```
1.22e1
1e2
1e+2
1e-2
.1e-2
1e10
```
They are evaluated as **Double**, unless you use `ExpressionOptions.DecimalAsDefault`

## DateTime and TimeSpan

Must be enclosed between sharps. 

```
#2008/01/31# // for en-US culture
#20:42:00# 
#08/08/2001 09:30:00# 
```
They are evaluated as DateTime. NCalc uses the current Culture to evaluate them.

## Booleans
Booleans can be either **true** or **false**.

```
true
```
## Strings

Any character between single quotes "'" are evaluated as **String**. 

```
'hello'
```

You can escape special characters using \\, \', \n, \r, \t.

## Function

A function is made of a name followed by braces, containing optionally any value as arguments.

```
  Abs(1), doSomething(1, 'dummy')
```
Please read the [[functions]] page for details.

## Parameters

A parameter as a name, and can be optionally contained inside brackets or double quotes.

```
  2 + x, 2 + [x]
```
